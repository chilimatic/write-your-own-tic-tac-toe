# write-your-own-tic-tac-toe


## the thing is to define what are the rules for tic tac toe
 - We have a board with 3 x 3 fields
 - the first player can start and puts her/his symbol/sign in one of the squares
 - the second player will follow up and put her/his symbol/sign in another square
 - the player who gets 3 of her/his symbols in a row will win
 - players are not allowed to remove their symbol/sign once they have been set
 - players are not allowed to put their symbol/sign in a square that already has one
 
## what do we need 

 - we need our board
 - we need our symbols/signs
 - we need to check after every round if a player won
 - we need to check our rules when a player takes an action
 
## this tutorial will be done in consecutive steps
 - you can see in the different folder the different steps
 - this is a web-tutorial and we're using javascript to make things easier to visualize
